# file-organizer-tool
A CLI and GUI tool intended to make organizing "loose" files in a directory into subfolders by file type simple. Though the basis is simple, this will be a fully fledged development project with functional utilities, unit testing, arg parsing, UI testing, and packaging. It will go through the full software development cycle.
