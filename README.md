# File Organizer Tool
File Organizer Tool is a utility designed to help users quickly organize “loose” files in a directory into subfolders based on file type. While the core functionality is simple, this project is a fully-fledged development effort that covers the entire software development lifecycle, including:
- Functional utilities
- Command-line interface (CLI) with argument parsing
- Unit testing
- GUI interface with PyQt
- UI testing
- Packaging for distribution
This project aims to provide a complete, professional-quality tool while serving as a hands-on example of end-to-end software development.
